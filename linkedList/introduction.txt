Linked List : Introduction

It can be visualized as a chain with different nodes connected, where each node represents a different element.

Unlike arrays they are not stored in continous memory allocations.
Elements are stored in non catagious memory allocations;

Linked list required 2 crucial piece of information for staorage
1.) Head -> It is described as the first node in a LL
2.) Tail -> It is described as the last node in a LL

the next is used to describe the next node in a Linked list.

Pointers:
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable
it "points" to the location in memory where data is stored.
The data can be accessed or manipulated by using the memory address

Application:
1.) Creating data structures such as stacks and queues
2.) Dynamic memory allocation
3.) Web browser

Types of linked list
1.) Single Linked List
each node points to the next node in the sequence
it moves in one direction from head to tail
2.) Double Linked List
each node points to both the next node and the previous node
bidirection traversal
3.) Circulat Linked List
each node points to both the next node and the previous node
