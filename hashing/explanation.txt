Hashing -> prestore and fetching

array = [1,2,1,2,3];

when asked about number of times an element occurs in an array.

1-> 2 occurs
2-> 1 occurs
3->1 occurs
10-> 0 occurs

Why finding a key in map is 0(log N)
Basically map is balanced binary search tree.
The search space is reduced by half.
The height of BST is always log n
